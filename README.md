# Scala Auxiliary Constructor Bug
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug that can arise when using auxiliary constructors in Scala.  Auxiliary constructors, while powerful, require careful attention to avoid unexpected behavior.

## The Bug
The `MyOtherClass` example shows how an auxiliary constructor can inadvertently lead to issues when a parameter in the primary constructor isn't correctly managed in an auxiliary constructor.  The provided code compiles, but it highlights a potential pitfall: what happens if someone tries to use the primary constructor?  The compiler error is crucial in catching the problem. This might go unnoticed in larger applications, leading to runtime exceptions or incorrect results.

## The Solution
The fix involves thoughtful design of auxiliary constructors to ensure all constructor parameters are handled consistently and correctly, preventing unexpected behavior or errors.
